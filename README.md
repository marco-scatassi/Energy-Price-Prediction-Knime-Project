##Machine learning project

We're glad to share our first approach in a Machine Learning project. The aim of our work was to predict energy price in Spain with two different approaches, one with regression and one with time series analysis, given a Kaggle dataset. The repository contains the article of our work and the relative Knime workflow. Enjoy the work!
